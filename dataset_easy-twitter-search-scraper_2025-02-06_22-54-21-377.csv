David Lebryk, a career Treasury Department official, was pushed out by the Trump administration. Lebryk oversaw over $1 billion in federal payments but allowed fraudulent transactions to proceed hundreds, if not thousands, of times—a blatant violation of the law.

This is exactly the problem with the federal government: unelected bureaucrats making policy decisions against the will of the elected president.

Lebryk didn’t just obstruct Trump’s executive order—he actively enabled financial misconduct.

The Trump administration has made it clear: there will be no tolerance for insubordination, corruption, or rogue officials who undermine the law. Agencies need to be slashed and held accountable—80% of this bureaucracy has no oversight, no transparency, and no legitimacy.
